### 1. Data Pre-processing in NN
**Explanation:**
Data pre-processing involves preparing the data to be used in a neural network (NN) by cleaning and transforming it to ensure the model can learn effectively.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Scaling**: The data is normalized to make sure all features contribute equally.
- **Creating Time Delays**: Various input vectors are created with time delays (lags) to capture historical patterns in the data.

**Purpose:** To ensure the data is clean, scaled, and structured properly for the NN.

### 2. Why Use 4 Time Delays?
**Explanation:**
Using 4 time delays means creating input vectors that include data points from the past 4 time steps.

**Purpose:**
- To capture historical patterns and trends in the data.
- To provide the NN with sufficient context from past data points to make accurate predictions.

### 3. Explain the AR Approach
**Explanation:**
The Auto-Regressive (AR) approach uses previous time points as inputs to predict future values.

**Purpose:**
- To leverage past data points to forecast future values.
- To identify patterns in the time series data.

### 4. Normalization
**Explanation:**
Normalization scales the data to a range, usually between 0 and 1.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Before Training**: Data is normalized before feeding it into the NN using the `normalization` function.

**Purpose:**
- To ensure all features contribute equally.
- To improve the convergence of the NN during training.

### 5. Un-Normalization
**Explanation:**
Un-normalization reverses the normalization process to bring the data back to its original scale.

**Usage in Program:**
- **After Prediction**: Predictions from the NN are un-normalized using the `unNormalization` function to interpret them in the original data scale.

**Purpose:**
- To convert the NN's output back to a meaningful scale.
- To compare predictions with actual values accurately.

### 6. Training Set and Test Set
**Explanation:**
The training set is used to train the NN, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Split Data**: The dataset is split into training (first 400 rows) and testing sets (remaining rows).

**Purpose:**
- To train the model on one part of the data and validate its performance on unseen data.
- To ensure the model generalizes well to new data.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
**Explanation:**
Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the NN's settings (like the number of hidden layers and nodes) to find the best configuration.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Different Models**: The program tests different configurations of hidden layers and nodes (e.g., one hidden layer with 5 nodes, two layers with 5 and 2 nodes).

**Purpose:**
- To find the most accurate and efficient model for the given task.

### 8. Standard Statistical Indices
**Explanation:**
Statistical indices like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SMAPE measure the accuracy of the NN's predictions.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Evaluate Performance**: These indices are calculated for each model to assess its performance.

**Purpose:**
- To quantify how close the NN's predictions are to the actual values.
- To compare different models' accuracy.

### 9. The Comparison Table
**Explanation:**
The comparison table summarizes the performance of different NN configurations based on the statistical indices.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Summary**: It lists input nodes, hidden layers, hidden nodes, and the performance metrics for each model.

**Purpose:**
- To easily compare the performance of various models.
- To identify the best-performing model.

### 10. Actual and Predicted Exchange Rates Time Plot
**Explanation:**
This plot shows the actual exchange rates over time alongside the predicted rates from the NN.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Visualization**: The `ggplot2` library is used to create the plot with actual and predicted values.

**Purpose:**
- To visually assess how well the NN's predictions follow the actual data trends.
- To identify any major deviations or patterns.

### 11. Actual and Predicted Exchange Rates Scatter Plot
**Explanation:**
This scatter plot compares actual exchange rates with the predicted rates, ideally showing a linear relationship.

**Usage in Program:**
- **Visualization**: The `ggplot2` library is used to create the scatter plot.

**Purpose:**
- To evaluate the NN's prediction accuracy visually.
- To identify how close the predictions are to the actual values by checking the scatter around the line y = x.
